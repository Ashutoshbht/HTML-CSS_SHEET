        <div class="about_data_info">
            <p>Nick is the Founder and CEO of boutique training company Working Voices. Over the last 20 years he’s developed more than 50 Courses, Workshops and Seminars in all areas of human communication. He has lectured at the London Business School and Columbia Business School and counts some of the world’s most successful companies as his clients, such as JPMorgan, Sony Music, Goldman Sachs, and BlackRock <br><br>. Nick’s political work is focused primarily in the UK and US where he works with politicians on everything from campaigns to communication strategy. Building political brands and crafting powerful speeches that get results are the lifeblood of his work, but he often provides an objective ear for his clients who are trying to solve a problem connected with their influence. <br><br> Nick is particularly interested in the effect of smartphones and social media on society. As our culture becomes increasingly screen based, our relationship with technology is fast becoming the dominant communication issue of our age. Nick lectures on this subject and works with young people and businesses, helping them to have a healthier online experience. He operates a website called yourlifeonsocialmedia.com to help people to change their relationship with social media via workshops. <br><br> Nick is also the Co-Founder and advisor to Curv, a new social network that looks to put collaboration at the heart of our online experience. <br><br> When coaching, Nick is inspirational and insightful. He believes in showing rather than telling and his style is conversational, challenging, and improvisational. <br><br>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Nick is often called upon to comment on current events in both the business and political spheres. He also works with charities and non-profit organisations. He enjoys mentoring young entrepreneurs and coaching people who wish to be in politics. <br><br> He lives in London</p>
