        <p>Are you in business, politics, or a position of responsibility? Do you want to influence those around you in a way that improves your reputation?<br><br> Do you want to be understood and remembered? Would you like to be highly respected and for people to act on what you’ve said after meeting you in person. Would you like to be able to tell a compelling story or give a speech that has your audience hooked? Maybe your needs are a little more human and lower key…maybe you’d like more confidence, to be more approachable and likeable and to influence other people in a way that generates warmth, admiration and connection…<br><br> If so, this is your opportunity to be personally coached by the Founder & CEO of the foremost professional skills training company in the world. <br> <br>For the last 20 years Nick Smallman, has been showing people all over the world how to develop their Charisma, Gravitas and Presence. These are the essential attributes of all highly successful people, and his executive coaching will give you these skills. <br> <br> <b>A different coaching method</b><br> A lot of executive coaching fails because the client is told what to do and to replace their current methods and technique. Unfortunately, human beings are creatures of habit and insecurity. Usually, we all revert to old behaviours, so the new way gets lost. <br><br> <b>Reorganising the mind</b><br>Nick will show you how to become an extraordinary speaker and communicator by using a series of psychological techniques that once employed and embedded, strengthen your ability over time. Good coaching is about changing your mind on a fundamental level rather than showing you what to do. Real growth is psychological. The physical will follow. He will teach you techniques not by telling you what to do but instead by giving you solutions that embed themselves in your thinking. Over time, many of the things you thought were beyond possibility become easy and natural.</p> <br>
